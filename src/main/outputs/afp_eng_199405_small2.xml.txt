''In Bonn , the head of the German Social Democratic Party , Rudolf Scharping , said in a statement he was `` very affected by the sudden death of John Smith .`` A good friend of German social democracy has left us too early .He was very close to achieving his life 's goal of making the Labor Party the largest political force in Britain '' and would be `` cruelly missed '' in Europe , he said .Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten , a former Conservative Party chairman , offered his condolences to the Smith family and said his former politcal opponent was a `` good and decent man , widely respected . ''In France , French President Francois Mitterrand sent a message of condolences to Smith 's widow Elizabeth and to Labor Party general - secretary Larry Whitty .The head of the French Socialist Party Michel Rocard told French radio Thursday he was `` shocked and stunned '' by Smith 's death :Rocard had spent Wednesday evening with Smith and his wife after attending the launch in London of the Labor Party campaign for the European elections .`` He was in great shape last night , and this came as a shock to me , '' Rocard said .`` John Smith was a fervant European .He fought for a Great Britain that would have a leading role in the building of Europe . ''In Brussels , European Commission President Jacques Delors , a French socialist , said Smith was `` a friend and companion in the struggle for justice and solidarity . ''He would be `` sorely missed by all who are striving for progress and , in particular , by all true Europeans . ''The Party of European Socialists also expressed its sorrow .Party president , Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes , said : `` Scotland and Britain have lost a great man , Europe has lost a great ally and the socialist family has lost a great leader .`` We have lost not just a great friend but a convinced and convincing European whose ideals and work sprang from deeply-held moral convictions and sense of justice .

France would not join a US military invasion of Haiti as part of an effort to restore democratic rule , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Thursday .Juppe , in Washington for talks with US officials , said he told US President Bill Clinton that Paris had ruled out participation in such an invasion force , which has been suggested as an option by Clinton and urged by some members of Congress .`` I confirmed that military intervention to kick out the military leadership is out of the question for us , '' Juppe told reporters in Washington .The French diplomat meanwhile reiterated his condemnation of the military regime in Port-au-Prince and the naming Wednesday of interim president Emile Jonassaint , whom Juppe described as a `` puppet with no legitimacy . ''He said France was working to enforce the latest UN Security Council resolution calling for stiffer sanctions if the military refuses to leave power and restore democracy by May 21 .France also was prepared to participate in a UN multinational force to help train a new Haitian police force once democracy is restored , Juppe noted .Juppe said such a force was in the process of being sent to Haiti last October before the collapse of an agreement to restore exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide .In an implicit criticism of US handling of the matter , Juppe said , `` Unfortunately the boat -LRB- with US and Canadian troops -RRB- turned back because there were a few people making noise on the port .

Chinese dissidents in the United States generally favor a partial withdrawal of Beijing 's privileged trading status targeting state - owned firms , not complete revocation , dissident leaders said here Thursday .There are differing views among the dissident community in the United States on the best way to advance human rights in China , but `` an overwhelming majority do agree on the middle policy of targeted revocation , '' Zhao Haiching , the president of the National Council for Chinese Affairs -LRB- NCCA -RRB- told a press conference .China has clearly not made the significant overall progress on human rights which President Bill Clinton said last year would be needed if he were to extend Beijing 's most favored nation -LRB- MFN -RRB- trading status beyond June 3 , Zhao said .But withdrawing MFN altogether would make everyone suffer for the government 's intransigence , said Zhao , whose group coordinates dissident groups in the United States pushing for human rights and democracy in China .Revoking MFN just for products which come mainly from state-owned enterprises would continue US pressure on the government to improve its human rights record , while not punishing the private sector and market economy which everybody wants to promote , Zhao said .Zhao also said it was the United States 's own fault that its decision to firmly link MFN to human rights this year had not borne more fruit .Mixed signals from Washington had convinced China `` that all they have to do to win MFN is play tough , and they have been doing so , '' Zhao said .Economic officials in the government made it clear early that revoking human rights would be an economic disaster for the United States .Chinese dissident Wang Juntao , jailed for his part in the 1989 pro- democracy movement which was crushed in the Tiananmen Square massacre , is in Washington this week meeting with lawmakers and US officials .Wang said that his release was a miracle , but urged the international community not to forget all the political prisoners still behind bars in China .Wang was to meet with Clinton 's national security advisor Anthony Lake Thursdsay and Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord Friday .
 
The Azerbaijani enclave of Nagorno Karabakh was torn by further fighting Thursday as unconfirmed reports of a possible new ceasefire circulated .Russian foreign ministry sources said a ceasefire accord was agreed Wednesday between the Azeri and Armenian defense ministers as well as pro-Armenian separatist forces fighting to prise the enclave from Azeri administration .The area has a largely Armenian population but falls within Azerbajian .The accord was due to have come into effect overnight but a spokesman for the Armenian rebels in the province told AFP there had been merely a photocopied exchange of propositions Wednesday on a possible laying down of arms .Armenia 's defense minister meanwhile told AFP that Yerevan was in no way party to a decision .Karabakh troops accused Azerbaijan of launching an attack Thursday on the back of intensive artillery bombardments around Agdam , just beyond the eastern edge of the disputed enclave and now under Armenian control .ITAR-TASS quoted the Azeri minister of defense as saying Baku 's forces had for more than 24 hours been engaged in clashes with the aim of retaking two villages in northern Karabakh .A spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry called on the warring parties to `` respect scrupulously '' the reported ceasefire agreement but also questioned the willingness of their political masters to seek a peaceful solution .Many earlier ceasefire accords have been broken in the conflict which has claimed more than 20,000 lives since fighting broke out in February 1988 .Peace talks chaired by the inter-parliamentary assembly of the Commonwealth of Independent States failed last week in Kirghizstan .

This time , Nigel Mansell will not be left behind on a restart .The English racer 's bid for victory here last year in his first Indianapolis 500 was foiled when eventual winner Emerson Fittpaldi and runner-up Arie Luyendyk passed him when a mid-race caution period ended .That was how Mansell learned passing was allowed on the 2.5-mile -LRB- 4k -RRB- oval here as soon as the green flag waves , not at the start-finish line .`` The restart was a painful lesson regarding the rules of the race track , '' Mansell said .`` There are some different rules here .Now I know about them .I was n't as prepared as I will be this year . ''The reigning Indy-car series champion will be among top contenders in Saturday 's battle for pole position in the 78th Indy 500 .Time trials for the May 29 race continue the next two weekends .`` I 'm optimistic , yes , but confident , no , '' Mansell said .`` It 's going to be a tough weekend .This track stands alone as king of the circuits .It carries a lot more excitement for the driver .It 's incredibly demanding here . ''Mansell 's Cosworth-powered Lola has a top speed of 227.969 mph -LRB- 364.750 k\/hr -RRB- during this week 's practice sessions .That ranks fifth for the week behind Brazilian 's Fittipaldi and Raul Boesel , Canada 's Paul Tracy and Mansell 's teammate , Mario Andretti .`` I 'm pleased with my speeds , '' Mansell said .`` We will work on the car and try to go a little quicker yet .When I came back here the first day I was probably a one .Now I 'm maybe a six on a learning scale .I 'll be up to nine or 10 by Saturday .But it takes time .
